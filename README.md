# Quiz-Management-System
A simple quiz management system built using NetBeans and includes GUI/Serialization/Objects

Default Logins:
Teacher: {teacher1, 123456}
Student: {student1, 123456}

The two files (quiz.ser & student.ser) are required for serialization to work. If the files are not present, the quiz is not created and student cannot access it similarly.
The application follows simple logic, teacher can create the quiz, edit the quiz, delete the quiz and check students marks. Student can attempt the quiz and check his/her marks. A student can only attempt the quiz once so make sure to add quizzes with different names as logic validates quiz name.
